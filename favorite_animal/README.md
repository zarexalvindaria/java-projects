# Program Name: FavoriteAnimal
**Description:** This program uses multiple nested switch statements to print a short fact about an animal by allowing a user to select from a set of Animal Classes > Group > Breed || Species || Type.

**For example**, a user can select "1. Mammals" from a set of Animal Classes, then he can select "1. Dogs" as his favorite Mammal, then he can select "1. Beagle" as his favorite dog. After selecting the breed, a short fact about the selected breed ("1. Beagle" for example) will be printed in the screen.

> The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare.
